# Deep Researcher

Deep Researcher is a fully local web research assistant that uses any LLM hosted by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search). Give it a topic and it will generate a web search query, gather web search results, summarize the results of web search, reflect on the summary to examine knowledge gaps, generate a new search query to address the gaps, and repeat for a user-defined number of cycles. It will provide the user a final markdown summary with all sources used to generate the summary.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/joshiayush/deepsearch.git
cd deepsearch
```

Then edit the `.env` file to customize the environment variables according to your needs. These environment variables control the model selection, search tools, and other configuration settings. When you run the application, these values will be automatically loaded via `python-dotenv` (because `langgraph.json` point to the "env" file).
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

### Selecting local model with Ollama

1. Download the Ollama app for Mac [here](https://ollama.com/download).

2. Pull a local LLM from [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search). As an [example](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:8b):
```shell
ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
```

3. Optionally, update the `.env` file with the following Ollama configuration settings. 

* If set, these values will take precedence over the defaults set in the `Configuration` class in `configuration.py`. 
```shell
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434" # Ollama service endpoint, defaults to `http://localhost:11434` 
LOCAL_LLM=model # the model to use, defaults to `llama3.2` if not set
```

### Selecting search tool

By default, it will use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) for web search, which does not require an API key. But you can also use [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/), [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) or [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-the-sonar-pro-api) by adding their API keys to the environment file. Optionally, update the `.env` file with the following search tool configuration and API keys. If set, these values will take precedence over the defaults set in the `Configuration` class in `configuration.py`. 
```shell
SEARCH_API=xxx # the search API to use, such as `duckduckgo` (default)
TAVILY_API_KEY=xxx # the tavily API key to use
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=xxx # the perplexity API key to use
MAX_WEB_RESEARCH_LOOPS=xxx # the maximum number of research loop steps, defaults to `3`
FETCH_FULL_PAGE=xxx # fetch the full page content (with `duckduckgo`), defaults to `false`
```

### Running with LangGraph Studio

#### Mac

1. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Launch LangGraph server:

```bash
# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uvx --refresh --from "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --with-editable . --python 3.11 langgraph dev
```

#### Windows

1. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment: 

* Install `Python 3.11` (and add to PATH during installation). 
* Restart your terminal to ensure Python is available, then create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Launch LangGraph server:

```powershell
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"            

# Start the LangGraph server
langgraph dev
```
